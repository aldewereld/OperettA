        <h2>Agents</h2>
        <h3>Step Through</h3>
      <p>Agents are constructed using the OperettA model and the actions model. An agent is created to perform each Role described in the OperettA model. Using the action model and the mapping from objectives to actions, the agents are given the actions their role performs.</p>
      <p> First a MAS model is generated which takes the OperettA model and the actions model. This contains a set of agents, one per Organisation Role, and the actions that are performed be that Role and hence by the agent. The second step takes the MAS model and produces a set of agent jars that will be injected into AgentScape. An agent jar is produced for each of the agents in the MAS model as well as several helper agents (i.e. a Planning agent that is asked to get plans for a task).</p>
<h4>Designing Agents from Scratch</h4>
        <p>Not applicable</p>
        <h4>Deriving Agents</h4>
        <p>To be added</p>
        <h3>Setup &amp; Initialise MAS</h3>
        <p>To be added</p>
        <h3>Generate MAS</h3>
        <p>The &quot;Derive&quot; button to generate the Multi-Agent System (MAS) will only be enabled when the OperettA, actions and ontology files are selected. The first time the &quot;Derive&quot; button is clicked, the system will ask where AgentScape is located. Select the top level folder and click OK. This location is stored so you will not be asked again. The result is a MAS model for the Organisation model containing agents that perform a role and the actions that role performs.</p>
        <h3>Generate Agents</h3>
        <p>Ensure that the &quot;Domain Ontology Name Space&quot; property in the MAS file is filled in with the base uri of the selected ontology. The second &quot;Derive&quot; button will only be enabled when the MAS has been generated. It translates the MAS model and creates separate java files for each agent. It then imports the remaining agent code from AgentScape, compiles the code and constructs the agent jars, one for each Organisation role and the supporting agents.</p>
        <h3>Start Agent Platform and Inject MAS</h3>
        <p>These steps are performed on the runtime dashboard so you will have to change to the Runtime Dashboard View to continue.</p>
        <h4>Configure Agent Platform</h4>
        <p>Supply the details for starting AgentScape:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Location Name – the location to be used by the agents running with AgentScape.</li>
          <li>Server Name – the address of the server running AgentScape. The default for running AgentScape on the local computer is &quot;http://localhost&quot;.</li>
          <li>Port – the port that AgentScape is running on. The default is 5555.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>If you use a proxy to access the internet, enter the details here. The default entry for the hosts that do not use the proxy is &quot;localhost|127.0.0.1&quot;</p>
      <p>      AgentScape requires a large java Virtual Machine (JVM) of at least 1024 MB. If it runs out of memory, choose a larger value.</p>
        <h4>Start Agent Platform</h4>
        <p>The start option starts AgentScape using the configuration details provided. Eclipse will be unresponsive until the start-up process has completed.</p>
        <h4>Stop/Restart Agent Platform</h4>
        <p>Currently there is no facility for stopping/restarting AgentScape from within Eclipse. Select the relevant option and follow the instructions given.</p>
        <h4>Inject MAS</h4>
        <p>This option will ask you to choose the plan and task to perform and will inject the agents into AgentScape. Again this will cause Eclipse to become unresponsive until the injection process has finished.</p>
        <h3>Agents &amp; Norms</h3>
        <p>Reminder regarding norms:</p>
        <p><u>Norm ID: </u>Must be non empty and unique</p>
        <p><u>Modality: </u>Must be non empty</p>
        <p><u>General Restrictions: </u>The formulas defined in the &quot;CS&quot; must be in accordance to the ontology (imported).</p>
        <p>Reminder regarding atomic actions:</p>
        <p>Every atom must have the &quot;Name&quot; filled in<br />
          Every atom must have the &quot;Concept&quot; filled in<br />
          If the atom’s &quot;Concept&quot; corresponds to a Class type:<br />
          Atom must have one argument which represents an object of the same type (and consequently the argument’s &quot;Concept&quot; must also have the same type)<br />
          If the atom’s &quot;Concept&quot; corresponds to a Property type:<br />
          Atom must have one or two arguments with some &quot;Concept&quot; of Class type<br />
          The arguments’ &quot;Concept&quot; must reflect the Domain and Range defined for the equivalent property in the ontology.<br />
          In the case that the Atom represents a &quot;Datavalued Property&quot; with Range &quot;Boolean&quot; in the ontology, then it must have one argument with &quot;Concept&quot; same to the Domain of the property in the ontology<br />
          Constants:<br />
          Must have the &quot;Concept&quot; filled in and the &quot;Type&quot; of the &quot;Concept&quot; must be Class or &quot;Individual&quot;</p>
        <h3>Best Practices (do)</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Bad Practices (don’t)</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Inter-dependencies</h3>
        <p>The agents depend on there being an ALIVE version of AgentScape being present. They need the EventBus and the web services deployed on a web server to be able to perform actions and produce events. They depend on the OperettA model, action model, task model and the ontology file. The plan model is optional as the agents can plan themselves to perform the tasks. They also need the service descriptions from the service level.</p>
        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <p>The agents will be unable to create their initial world state, so will be unable to enact any task if the &quot;Domain ontology Name Space&quot; property is not filled in on the MAS model.</p>
