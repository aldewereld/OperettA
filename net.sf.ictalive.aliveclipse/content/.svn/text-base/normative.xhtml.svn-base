        <h2>Normative Structure</h2>
        <p>The normative structure expresses organisational norms and regulations to roles, where norms define the obligations, permissions, and prohibitions of the actors in the organisation, related to the roles they play, or to a particular area of activity.</p>
<p>To create a norm, right click the &quot;NS&quot; element in the tree-editor, select &quot;New Child&quot; and choose &quot;Norm&quot;. Norms are automatically given an identifier for tracking, which can be edited (but should never be empty). A norm consists of a number of partial state descriptions that describe the moment that the norm becomes active (&quot;Activation Condition&quot;), when the norm is no longer active (&quot;Expiration Condition&quot;), what should be maintained during the life-cycle of the norm (&quot;Maintenance Condition&quot;), and possibly the deadline before the roles should have acted upon this norm (&quot;Deadline&quot;). With the exception of the latter, each of these conditions needs to be filled. This is done by creating a Partial State Description as described in the previous section, and selecting that from the drop-down list that appears when you click on either of these property fields.</p>
<p>Every norm needs to be given a Deontic Statement, which defines the type of norm (Obligation, Permission, Prohibition), the role or player to which this norm applies, and what is obliged/permitter/forbidden by this norm. There are two types of Deontic Statement:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:10px;">
  <li>Role Deontic Statement: this type of statement applies to all actors/players enacting a particular role;</li>
  <li>Individual Deontic Statement: this type of statement applies only to a particular player in a particular scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Deontic Statement is created by right clicking the norm in the tree-editor, selecting &quot;New Child&quot; and then choosing the appropriate type of Deontic Statement. In the properties of the Deontic Statement you can set the modality of the norm (the type), the role or player that this norm applies to, and the partial state description that expresses what this norm is about.
</p>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<p>Some considerations when creating norms in the normative structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Variable instantiation in the normative reasoner of ALIVE happens based on those present in the &quot;Activation Condition&quot;. Basically, when the norm is activated, a norm instance is created with its variables substituted in such a way that the &quot;Activation Condition&quot; matches the current state. Any variables that are <em>not</em> present in the Activation Condition, but in other parts of the norm, are essentially considered as 'unimportant' for the evaluation of that condition/formula. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Norm creation example</h3>
<p>This example models the creation of a norm to fulfil the following constraint: &quot;<em>It is forbidden to suggest adult content to underage users</em>&quot;.</p>
<p> As in the TMT application the role responsible of suggesting content is the <em>Content Adaptor</em> role, the deontic statement of the norm applies to the <em>Content Adaptor</em> role.</p>
<p> To model the norm we start by defining the concepts on the norm, that is (adultContent, suggest and underage) as shown in the figure below. Notice, some of the concepts are high-level concepts derived from lower level concepts via counts-as rules. For instance, a pub or a peep-show being adult content, or the <em>Underage</em> concept.</p>
<p> Once the concepts have been defined we go on applying them to the norm.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activation condition: The norm becomes active when the user is underage. Thus, underage concept comes in handy for this.</li>
  <li>Deadline: Does not apply to this norm</li>
  <li>Expiration condition: The norm stops being active when the user is not underage. Thus, underage concept comes in handy for this.</li>
  <li>Maintainance condition: During all the norm life-cycle (after it is active, and until it has been deactivated) it is true that, if a given content is considered to be Adult age content (that is, counts as adult age content) this content has not been suggested to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the norm includes some concepts derived from basic concepts (such as negations, and the implication).</p>
<p> Once the norm has been defined, we define the deontic statement for the norm:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Modality: Forbidden, the norm is forbidding something</li>
  <li>Role: Content adaptor role, being the one responsible of the concept used in <em>what.</em></li>
  <li>What: suggest(X), the concept (in this case, an action) that is being forbidden. </li>
</ul>
